description: A small reset so I can tend to things in peace.

Every so often the creative things in my life become a burden that I overthink. Which means, this blog needs a small reset. I would love a huge beautiful redesign but the creative juices aren't quite flowing. In the meantime, there are some technical things I want to work on (automating some workflows, webmentions, etc) that I don't want to feel blocked because I'm agonizing over font choices.

So, things will be wonderfully messy for a bit, giving me the space I need to tend things here and there in my small digital home. I reset the styles and markup to the barest minimum I could stand while still hopefully readable.

If there is anything egregiously broken, feel free to reach out on [Github](https://github.com/hbuchel/heather-buchel.com/issues)
