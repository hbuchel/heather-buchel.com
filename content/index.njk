		<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Heather.  I like web standards. I'm an advocate for the platform and for the humans using it. Sometimes I even get to do that for my job as a front-end engineer.</p>
		<p>I like blending my experience in user interface design with web accessibility. Front-of-the-front-end is my vibe.</p>
