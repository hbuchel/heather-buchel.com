As a front-end engineer, my area of focus is accessibility and user interface development. I love working in the UX space and collaborating with designers to build accessibility-driven experiences. I have experience building design systems and UI for products in large, global organizations.

## Current work

Currently, I am a senior front-end engineer at Squarespace on the Web Accessibility and Performance team.


## Future work

I enjoy working on the front-of-the-front end. You can find <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/">a great write-up of this position</a> by Brad Frost. Essentially, this means I'm interested in roles where:
- I'm able to influence design and can work closely with UX and UI designers. I like bridging the gap between the design world and engineering, and bringing the two together.
- I'm able to influence early product design decisions to ensure we're building accessible solutions.
- I'm able to focus on UI development; this can include a focus on CSS and the presentational side of the front-end space, working with design systems and creating component libraries, performance and cross-browser testing, accessibility testing, etc.
- I'm able to collaborate with back-end engineers to ensure our work on the back-end supports our UX and vice versa.
